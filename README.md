# Week-13-Homework

Click "launch binder" to render Docker image and build Binder session in R - May take several minutes. Once this has been completed, the next time the image is launched, it should load quickly. Your homework is to follow the script and run the cell contents. In some instances you will be asked to insert some code of your own to run.

Once the Binder session is built, click on the script with the .ipynb extension (IPYNB File extension) and launch the Jupyter Notebook with script and notes on this week's homework assignment. The cells of the Jupyter Notebook script can be run using the play (run) button or using Ctrl+Enter [Runs cell and remains in current cell] or Shift+Enter [Runs cell and moves to next cell].
